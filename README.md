# GameOfLife

The game "Life" was invented by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It was popular not only among his colleagues. The fascination of the game "Life" is evidenced by the results of many interesting studies and numerous computer implementations. At the same time it is directly related to the field of mathematics - the theory of cellular automata.  
  
The rules of the game "Life" are quite simple:  
1) "Life" is played out on an infinite cellular field.
2) Each cell has 8 neighbouring cells.
3) A creature can live in every cell.
4) A creature with two or three neighbours survives in the next generation, otherwise it dies from loneliness or overpopulation.
5) In an empty cage with three neighbours, a creature is born in the next generation.
